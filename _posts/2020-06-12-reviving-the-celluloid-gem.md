title: "Reviving the Celluloid gem"

main-class: 'celluloid'
tags:

- celluloid
introduction: 'As of now Celluloid is unmaintained due to the difficulties introduced by the last release 1.5 years ago. The overall goal for the summer is to get Celluloid in a good shape so the community around it can reform and keep on going further'
---

The process of reaching `0.18.0` got stalled mid-way through, and there are deprecation warnings and other difficulties which prevent `Celluloid` from functioning smoothly for all dependent gems.

* Test for language compatibility after changes took place in `Ruby` over the past 3-5 years.
* Audit all outstanding tickets, and the Ideas List above, and determine what issues can remove the maximum "pain" for people still dependent on `Celluloid`.
* Update the test suite to resolve outstanding issues there, and provide more certainty in the code.

The goal is to get `Celluloid` to a place where it can skip `0.18.0` and be within reach of `1.0`, and possibly attract a new maintainer to take over from the previous maintainer to take the gem further.
